# Vanilla JS MVC app


### Description

Based on front end challenge, I've create an app based on MVC pattern in vanilla js - no framework.

Not suitable for production, this is just an implementation of my understanding how mvc frameworks/spa works. 

### Requirement

For the App to work, [node 8.9.4](https://nodejs.org/en/) must be installed.

### usage

download the repo or

``` 
$git clone https://github.com/geronde/Vanillajs-mvc-app.git  and cd vanillajs-mvc-app

```

Then install

```
npm i

```

Run the app:

```
npm run start

```
